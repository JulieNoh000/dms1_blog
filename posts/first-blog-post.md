# A disembodied hands of a great ape

![hands](hands.png)

**I found it as an answer for a disembodied hands of a great ape. The moment I read it, luckily, I remember that I saw some strange hands on the way to the class today.**

*It was located in front of the building 6.*

# A golden globe atop a tower of eights

**After I found the previous one, my team mates and I had no clue about the answers to the remaining hints. So I suggested that we should just walk around the answer zone. When we reached triangle-shaped area next to the buikding 13, I saw a golden sphere on top of a long tower. And I saw three eights at the top of the tower, I was sure that this was the answer.**
