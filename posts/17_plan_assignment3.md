**I brainstormed on the theme of significant life changes. There were few changes that came to my mind but I thought that studying abroad was definitely the biggest change in my life. Therefore, I focused on the environmental and locational changes related to studying abroad. For my top-down map, I divided it into three main sections: Korea, Canada, and Australia. <br>In Korea, the key moment is in my room. This space is the most familiar and comforting place for me, representing coziness, security, and myself before the huge decision.<br>In Canada, the key moment is the city itself (especially downtown). Canada was the first place where I lived alone away from home, which led me to explore and experience the city. This exploration significantly impacted my mental growth. However, downtown includes the reasons why I wanted to leave Toronto. My previous school in downtown was unsatisfactory, and there were various dangerous and inconvenient factors. Like what I said, the city had a significant impact on my life, that's why it is one of the key moments.<br>In Australia, the key moment is nature (the sea, animals, etc.). The weather was one of the factors in my decision to come to Australia and also gives me a sense of how my life has changed. The weather here is much warmer compared to Toronto, where there was no sea. The change in environment such as weather and nature is a key point.
