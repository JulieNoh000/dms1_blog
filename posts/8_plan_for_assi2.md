# Mind map


<img src="mindmap.jpg" width="800" height="1000">

**I learned how to add or delete artboards from the video tutorials, which was new to me and something I found very useful. The technique I used most frequently was to duplicate shapes with the option key, which helped me efficiently create multiple squares for my design.**

# Target audience and platform

**My icons are for a mobile weather app and a PC weather website. The app is available for iPhone and Android phones. The website can be accessed on a PC. These responsive icons will be used for daily weather displays, especially for showing changes in weather throughout the day. The target audience is users who want to see the changes in weather throughout the day in visual graphics.**
