# Mind map


<img src="mm.jpg" width="800" height="1000">

**I chose the word 'climate' because it is a topic that significantly impacts human life. When I think of 'climate,' I think of the overall climate that can affect a country's culture and people. Secondly, climate change, which is a major concern in current society, and the last thing is weather, which influences people's daily lives. Among these, I chose climate change as the topic because I thought responsive icons could be helpful in explaining various ways to deal with climate change.**

# Target audience and platform

**My icons will be used on a website that provides information about climate change. The website is accessible on both PC and mobile devices. My icons are designed to help users understand information related to environmental protection and sustainable energy.**
