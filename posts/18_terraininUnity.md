**In today's class, I tried using the terrain feature in Unity for the first time. I learned how to  transform the height and shape of the terrain, as well as painting colors and textures on it. At first, I was confused because the terrain height wouldnâ€™t change, but I resolved the issue by switching the option from â€˜Stamp Terrainâ€™ to â€˜Raise and Lower Terrain.â€™ To be honest, I didnâ€™t even know how to create terrain before today's class, but Iâ€™m proud that I learned how to create it and apply the textures. Also, Iâ€™m happy that this activity will be useful for my assignments.**
