**When I was trying to upload the playtesting and final video for Project 3 to Vimeo, I was running out of storage space and had to delete the videos of Project 1 without backing them up. I thought I had the original footages and the final video on my drive, but I realized that I didn't while looking for the materials from Project 1 to put on my website. All I had were a few screenshots taken during the filming process. <br>Through this experience, I learned that it is very important to properly back up all the processes and final outcomes of every project.**
