**My video consists of sequences that start with a zoom-in on a location from a high point, transitioning to footage shot at that location, such as a park, an art gallery, and the RMIT building. These places represent my interests, passions, and inspirations. This repetitive technique symbolizes my ongoing journey to find and achieve my goals, both in life and as a student in the digital media program. It captures not only my passion for exploring various places but also the diverse challenges throughout my life.**
