**In today's class, I installed Unity and the Unity Editor, created a new project in the 3D format, and set up folders for materials and textures. I downloaded and imported planet and moon textures from the provided website. I applied textures to sphere and cube objects and added moon material to the background. I felt good when these initial attempts were successful, but I still don't fully understand how material and texture folders work, so I need to explore and experiment with those more.**
