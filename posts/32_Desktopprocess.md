**During the process of creating the desktop version, I tried to make the heading in the title page as engaging as possible by using various fonts. I also added animations to the bio section to make it more interesting for users. For the navigation page, I made responsive buttons that users can see what the project is about when they hovers over each button, and clicking on it smoothly scrolls to each project page. Each project page allows users to preview the project and scroll horizontally to view the process. After completing the desktop version, I realized that the same background color throughout the whole website made it look too plain, so I added some decoration using the blur effect. To make it move, I used the After Delay and Smart Animate features. Implementing animations like a responsive navigation button was quite challenging, but it was also rewarding, and Iâ€™m very satisfied with the result.**
