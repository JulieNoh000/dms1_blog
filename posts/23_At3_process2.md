**The Canada zone is composed of tall buildings, roads, and cars to capture the aspect of a city. Specifically,the trees covered with snow represent the first impression I had of Canada. The tall tower is the CN Tower, one of Toronto's landmarks. <br> During the process of building the Canada zone, I made some adjustments to the map layout. I wanted to ensure that the character wouldn't be able to see the mountain in the Australia zone when it is in the Canada zone. So, I moved all the objects in the Canada zone little bit closer to the mountain and added a few more tall buildings. <br>It was really fun to place small details like a fountain, bus stop, bench, and traffic lights because I had never tried something similar to urban design before.**
