**I believe first impressions are important in everything. I didnâ€™t want the first impression of my website to feel too boring, so I decided to create an impressive illustration that represents me. Using Adobe Illustrator, I made a simple yet distinctive illustration. Iâ€™m quite satisfied with how it turned out, as it conveys the mood I wanted and fits well with my websiteâ€™s overall theme.**
