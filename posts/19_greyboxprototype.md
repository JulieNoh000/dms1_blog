**This is a simple greybox prototype showing the map I imagined and designed lastweek. <br> For the Korea zone, I decided to solely focus on my room because it has a strongest meaning to me than the outside world. Initially, I planned to combine both nature and urban elements for Canada and Australia. However, with that composition, I realized that it would be hard to clearly convey the meaning of the changes I experienced. So, I chose to focus on the urban aspects of Canada and the natural, especially beach, scenery for the Australia zone.<br> In addition to that, I intended to make the three zones in similar size at first. But because of the characteristics of each zone, I changed my mind to make my room smaller and expand the other two areas. In my room, I placed furniture such as a desk, bed, bookshelf, and closet. For the Canada zone, I tried to give an urban vibe by placing buildings, a large tower, and roads. In the Australia zone, I emphasized nature elements by creating mountains, the ocean, and trees. In the process of making the rough shape of ocean, I couldn't figure out how to lower the terrain, so I raised the rest of the areas instead. I think I need to study more about this part. I also want to learn how to create doors to allow the character to move between zones. Additionally, I need to learn how to make the ocean with the texture.**
