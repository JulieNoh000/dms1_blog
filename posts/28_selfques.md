# Self Reflection Questions



<br>

**Assignment 1**

<br>

**How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?**
<br>
When selecting the audio file for my video, I tried to find sounds that best matched the meaning and atmosphere of each scene. The emotional tone of the place also played a significant role in my audio choices. I believe the audio should improve the message or emotion conveyed by each scene, ensuring that the sound and visuals harmonize well, allowing viewers to relate better with the video.
<br><br>

**How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?**
<br>
When selecting the footage to use in my project, I aimed to create a lot of visual options by trying different angles and perspectives. I filmed the same location multiple times to compare them and made the final choices during the editing process. The most important factors I considered were the distractions in the footage, proper focus, and how well the footage conveyed the message or atmosphere I wanted to express. I also carefully considered how each angle would evoke emotions in the viewers. This process was crucial for maintaining the video's flow and smooth transitions.
<br><br>

**What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?**
<br>
During the editing process, I tried applying different audio files to the same scene and learned how much a sound can change the mood of a scene.  For example, adding calm music to the same landscape scene gives a peaceful feeling, while using more intense sounds creates a completely different, tense atmosphere. By choosing sounds that matched the meaning of each scene, I enhanced the emotions of that specific place and moment. 
<br><br>

**How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?**
<br>
Editing is a key process that determines the speed and rhythm of the video. Speed refers to how quickly the video progresses, while rhythm refers to the patterns of transitions between scenes and changes in visuals. Both of them significantly affect how the video is experienced by the audience and how they relate to the story. In my project, I adjusted both elements by making certain scenes last a bit longer or using quick cuts. Also, I tried not to use too slow or too fast transitions to make sure the scenes flowed naturally. This approach allowed me to effectively express my feelings for each scene.
<br><br>

**Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?**
<br>
In the video, the main personality that I wanted to talk about was my adventurous nature, which involves exploring new places and enjoying various experiences. Through this, I conveyed the message that I have had many diverse experiences in my life so far and I will continue to grow through new challenges in the future.
<br><br>

**What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?**
<br>
I put an effort into capturing the unique beauty of each location as much as possible. Particularly for the park scene, I chose a clear day with good lighting so that the true colors could be well presented. Also, I carefully considered the camera angles to highlight the meaning of each location. Through these aesthetic choices, each scene of my project could deliver a visually appealing and meaningful experience.
<br><br>

**Assignment 2**
<br>

**How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?**
<br>
I chose the word "climate" because it is closely related to human life. Icons are visually easy to recognize, so I wanted to help people quickly understand important information, such as environmental protection. Climate change is a significant issue we face today, and I believe that representing solutions to climate change through icons is very educational and practical.
<br><br>

**Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?**<br>

I sketched nine designs for each icon, which means 81 sketches overall. I started with simple ideas, but as I sketched more and more, lots of diverse design ideas came up in my head. This process broadened my range of options, and my initial designs evolved into more concise designs that clearly convey meaning. In the end, I chose easily understandable and functional icons.
<br><br>

**How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?**
<br>Based on my thumbnail sketches, I needed to make some adjustments while working in Adobe Illustrator. As I used the pen tool and stroke thickness feature, some aspects were expressed differently than I initially designed. However, working in a digital environment allowed me to create neater icons and adjust some elements to convey the meaning of the icons more clearly. During this process, I also made better visual consistency.
<br><br>

**How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?**
<br>
The first color I wanted to use was green, as I believed it was an appropriate color to symbolize environmental protection. Later, while experimenting with color variations, I chose the analogous combination of green, yellow, and blue. This combination makes my icons visually appealing. Additionally, I felt that this color combination was suitable for symbolically representing climate and nature.
**How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?<br><br>

**How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?** <br>
I selected sounds that could make the interaction process with the icons more engaging. I avoided overly long or complex sounds that could ruin the simplicity of the icons. Instead of sounds that remind users of something specific, I wanted short sounds that feel like pressing a button.
<br><br>

**How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?** <br>
The first words that came to mind when considering "climate" were weather and climate change. Initially, I was thinking of creating icons representing weather changes in a day, but during the sketching phase, I felt like these icons wouldn't effectively convey the message. Instead, I thought that it would be more practical and meaningful to show the ways to deal with climate change such as environmental protection strategies, through icons. This approach could allow the icons to raise awareness about climate change.
<br><br>

**Assignment 3**
<br>

**How important was a working prototype to your design process?**
<br>Creating a prototype was very helpful in visually organizing the chaotic ideas in my head. The prototype allowed me to clearly make and see the overall map layout and design. That made me identify issues or elements that needed improvement. By building the prototype, I was able to reduce the confusion in the initial steps of my creative process. <br><br>

**What did it offer that process?**
<br>The prototype not only provided visual organization but also an opportunity to fix potential problems during the early phase. This allowed me to reduce errors that could come up in the final version. <br><br>

**How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?**
<br>Creating a 3D environment was quite a different experience compared to 2D. In 3D, I had to consider how objects or spaces would look from all angles. When placing objects such as buildings or trees, it was important to ensure they look natural and appropriate from all viewpoints.  <br><br>

**What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?**
<br>In assignment 3, the virtual camera functioned as the character's perspective, showcasing scenes from the user's viewpoint. In contrast, the camera in the first assignment focused on capturing specific scenes that convey the messages with more intentional compositions and directing. Although both projects used the camera to show important visual information, their specific roles were somewhat different. <br><br>

**How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?**
<br>In assignment 3, I tried to make it realistic by using actual sounds from each location or object. In contrast, in assignment 1, all audio files were not directly related to the places or objects but aimed to express the atmosphere. For assignment 2, I chose a simple interaction sound. Project 3 concentrated on the reality of sound, while the earlier assignments focused on mood and interactivity. <br><br>

**How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the projectâ€™s development?**
<br>Under the broad theme of "change," I expressed this concept by focusing on my study abroad experience across three different places: Korea, Canada, and Australia. I emphasized the meaning of each area by adding only natural elements in the Australia zone and only urban elements in the Canada zone. Through this process, I was able to create an environment that was more accurate to the theme. <br><br>

**What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldnâ€™t have discovered otherwise?**
<br>Through playtesting, I discovered that the sounds were too low, the character speed was too fast, and the mouse sensitivity was too high. Without the playtesting, I wouldnâ€™t have realized that users might not be able to hear the sound properly and thus could not fully experience the atmosphere of each location. Besides, the overly fast speed and sensitive mouse controls could have made my map unsatisfactory. <br><br>
